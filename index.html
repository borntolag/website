  <h2>What is the IT Skills Mentor Network</h2> 
  <section id="mission">
    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>IT Skills Mentor Network provides a way to link learners with subject matter experts across a wide range of skillsets in Information Technology.  There is no cost to the student except for a willingness to commit to a few hours per week to learn a desired skill.  Our instructors donate their time to help improve the IT community.</p>
  </section>
 
  <section id="approach">
     <h3>Approach</h3>
     <p>Prospective students submit a request stating their area of interest.</p>
	 <p>A list of tutors is provided that have industry knowledge to help the student.</p>
	 <p>Tutors connect with the student to arrange a 4-6 week plan to give them a roadmap to success. </p>
	 <p>The Student's final assignment is to generate a presentation on youtube with a powerpoint deck showing what they have learned.  This allows the student to contribute back to the community so that others can learn. </p>

   <section id="founder">
      <h3>Founder</h3>
 	  <p>David Gresham formed the idea of this type of a network while he was an IT Architect Manager @ Optum Technology.  David started out as a programmer/analyst to develop financial accounting software.  From there he expanded to infrastrucre, networking, and security. </p>
	  <p>He wanted to inspire his team to improve by developing a continuous learning program that would allow team members to select a skill that they wanted to learn. </p>
   </section>

  <section id="sponsors">
     <h3>Corporate Sponsors</h3>
     <p>IT Skills Mentor Network is developing a reachout program where companies can provide resources in terms of possible volunteers and a place to do a meetup for various topics.  Sponsorship could provide food and refreshment for a minimal cost and receive 5 minutes to talk about themselves.</p>
